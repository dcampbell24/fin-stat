financial-accounts
===================

An application for tracking your personal finances.

To get the gold price I use a service from goldapi.io and it requires a token
(free for 100 requests per month). The token is stored in a file named
"www.goldapi.io-access-token.txt" stored in the same directory as the program
is run from. You will get a crash if you try to run the program and get the
gold price without it.
